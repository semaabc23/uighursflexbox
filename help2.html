        How can you help?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Start by talking about it. We live in the age of social media. Even in a global pandemic,
        millions of people come together over social media to spread a movement. We need to be
        spreading more information about what is going on and help one another become aware of the crisis.
        Sign petitions and post about what is going on.
        <br>
        <br>
        Reach out to local news stations and radio hosts and request them to speak on the matter. Just
        as people asked and demanded celebrities to talk about BLM and the 2020 Election, let's ask
        them to discuss this and acknowledge the crisis. Contact senators and local government and urge
        them to take action.

        Consider volunteering and donating.
      </h2>
      <p>
      If you have the means to do so, please donate to the Uighur Human Rights
        Project at <a href="https://uhrp.org/what-you-can-do">UHRP</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Volunteer or intern with UHRP and take a stand on this pressing and horrific human
        rights violation.
