        What is going on?
      </h2>
      <p>
      Over one million Uighurs have been interned by the Chinese government and
        sent to concentration camps within Xinjiang since 2017. The government has
        detention camps set up in which the Muslim minority group, Uighurs, are
        suppressed and tortured.
        <br>
        <br>
        The people of the Uighur community are taken and interrogated and beaten
        because of their religion. In these camps, they are forced to do things that
        are against their religion such as consume alcohol, eat pork, and pledge to
        convert to another religion.
        <br>
        <br>
        Nearly a hundred camps have been identified in the Northwest China region where
        the Uighurs have been detained. The government refers to at "re-education centers"
        trying to conceal the human rights violation that is going on.

      <h2>
        Who are the Uighurs and why are they being targeted?
      </h2>
      <p>
      There are nearly 11 million Uighur Muslims who reside in Xinjiang. The land in which
        they live in was previously called East Turkestan. In 1949 it was annexed, and since then
        Xinjiang has been under control of China.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the past Uighur militants were involved in atttacks in China. China usese these attacks
        to claim that Uighurs hold extremist views and as a whole they have the potential to be a
        great threat to the country's security.
        <br>
        <br>
        Beginning in 2017, the Xinjiang government began to place restrictions on things that have
        been associated with Muslims. Men were prohibited from growing long beards as women were refrained
        from wearing headscarfs. Not only were people being restricted, but mosques began to be destructed
        signifying the destruction of the Muslim religion.
