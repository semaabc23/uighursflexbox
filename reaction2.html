      <h2>
        How has the world responded?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There has been an immense lack of response to the crisis happening in China.
        Barely any huge news broadcasters have covered the pressing matter. Not only has
        China been effective in keeping this information from the public until recently,
        but the public barely had a strong response upon finding out.
        <br>
        <br>
        At first 22 countries consisting mostly of European countries condemned
        the Chinese leadership in a letter to the U.N. Human Rights Council.
        However, days after, 37 countries defended China by excusing the actions
        which "protected the country from terrorism".
        <br>
        <br>
        Long after these actions, the U.S. condemned China along with another 30 countries
        as they referred to it as a "horrific campaign of repression."

      <h2>
        Why isn't this getting the coverage it needs?
      </h2>
      <p>
      China is extremely secretive about what goes on within their country. It took a long
        time for people to figure out what was going on in the first place. When people
        took notice of the construction sites for the camps, the news about the camps began
        to spread.
        <br>
        <br>
        These abuses have been documented for years now and still the general public barely
        knows any information regarding the situation. Why is it that the Holocaust, which
        is a devastating period in our history, is condemned, but when a different religious
        group is suffering from similar torturous acts today, the world isn't reacting with as
        much intensity?
        <br>
        <br>
        Muslims have time and time again been sterotyped and labeled as terrorists. At airport
        security "random" checks, someone with a long beard and the last name "Ahmed" will always
        "randomly" get selected. When the phrase, "Allahu Akbar", which literally means "God is the
        greatest" is uttered, people begin to look in fear. Muslims are dying, being tortured and killed
        in concentration camps in this very moment and the world continues to look away.
